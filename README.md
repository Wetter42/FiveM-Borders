# FiveM-Borders
Before we get started, do NOT PASS ON THIS CONTENT AS YOUR OWN! THIS IS MY SHIET! Do NOT SELL MY CONTENT. It's intended for everyone. NOT PRIVATE, FREE!  


Also you're free to use this however you like, but just be sure to credit me if using in video / part of another mod! Thanks!
========================================================================================================================================

Introduce the Borders script! This is my first official release for FiveM and for ANY game.  It's simple and yet, so effective.  Basically It's a mod that allows you to view the maps boundaries in a non-intrusive way! 

To activate the mod, simply type: 
/borders on
OR
/borders off

Simple, right? 
The great thing about it is that it's client sided, so you can toggle it if you just want to fly the perimeter or leave it on to ensure your wings don't clip / boat sinks! 

Anyways, I really hope you guys enjoy! 

And REEEEAAAALLLY quick, A HUUUGE shoutout to SpikE_Odets for helping me clean up my code (object oriented languages are weird), a smaller shoutout to Jamelele1, and the smallest to: Nick78111!

Anyways, I hope you enjoy! 
A demonstration can be found here:

Lastly, I will be doing very minimal support on this as it's a very simple script, I'm not an expert, or even proficient or fluent in lua, and it doens't take rocket science to install! 

Anyways, if you need help, please go to the releases page on the forums to be able to ask for help, or PM me on the FiveM forums! 
Cheers! 


How to install: 
To install, simply throw the folder / directory named "marker" into your resources folder, and in the server.cfg (OR resources.cfg if you're a boss 8D ), start the resource.  
Example: 

Me: *Puts Marker folder in my server's resources directory*
Also Me: *Using resources.cfg --> adds line: "ensure marker" to the end of the file!

Note that the resource name is CASE SENSITIVE (if you didn't already know that!)
Make sure to delete / remove the server cache after adding this for the first time to avoid any screwups! 

Thanks!
